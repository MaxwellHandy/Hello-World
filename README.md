# Hello-World
Repository created while going through the GitHub new user guide.

Editing the ReadMe file per the tutorial. Learning about "commits". Looked up the "md" file extension, which stands for "markdown". Though this is a plain text editor, I'm assuming I could add some minor formatting modifications (eg, bolding) since this is markdown. <b>Testing bold text.</b> Yup.
